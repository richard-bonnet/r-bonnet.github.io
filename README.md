  <p>I love to surf, DJ and surf, skate, snowboard and play any sport that makes me sweat!</p>

  <h1>About Me</h1>
  
  <p>Ispend my time between Isabela, Puerto Rico and New York City. I live any sports period. Competition is something that drives me. Ireally love board sports. So anytime I can surf, skateboard and snowboard is super fun for me. But I love to create art, read, cook and DJ Hip Hop as well. I am the quintessential jack of all trades and master to some ðŸ˜Ž </p>
  <p>Life is short, play hard!</p>
  <p>I am also really into aliens and the paranormal. But aliens ðŸ‘½, UFO's ðŸ›¸ and UAP's. Isabela, Puerto Rico is a hot spot for UFO activity and high strangeness in general, so weird stuff happens there all the time. I have stories to tell!</p>
  <p>I also enjot podcasting, video editing and writing. I am currently writing a book named "The Lost Siren of Isabela" amongst other things such as short stories and my substack that I am trying to build up. Creativity drives me and fuels my desire to leave an indelible mark on others. But my mood effects my inspiration in both good ways and bad, so I have to know how to navigate my emotions and ideas to really get the best out of myself.</p>
